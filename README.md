## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm/yarn
- **Android SDK** (for APK patching features)
- **Frida** (for dynamic injection - optional)
- **macOS/Windows/Linux**

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tonynhox/trafexia-clone.git
cd trafexia-clone

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will launch with hot reload enabled for development.

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build for current platform
npm run build

# Build for macOS (Intel)
npm run build:mac

# Build for macOS (Apple Silicon)
npm run build:mac-arm

# Build for Windows
npm run build:win

# Build for Linux
npm run build:linux
```

Executables will be generated in the `dist-electron/` folder.

> [!TIP]
> **🍎 macOS "App is damaged" Warning Fix:**
> Since this is a free, unsigned package, Google Chrome/macOS Gatekeeper will automatically quarantine it and show the error: _"Trafexia is damaged and can't be opened."_
> To fix this instantly, open your Terminal on macOS and run:
>
> ```bash
> xattr -cr /Applications/Trafexia.app
> ```
>
> _(Make sure you have dragged the Trafexia app into your `/Applications` directory first)._

   - **Response Headers**: Custom headers
   - **Response Body**: JSON, XML, or plain text response
3. Matching requests will receive the mocked response

**Request Throttling:**

- Open **Throttle Control**
- Set bandwidth limits and latency
- Simulate slow network conditions
- Useful for testing app performance on poor connections

### Frida Injection

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need a rooted/jailbroken device?**
A: No! Trafexia can patch APKs and inject scripts without requiring root access. However, Frida injection requires a rooted device.

**Q: Can I use this on apps with certificate pinning?**
A: Yes! That's one of the main features. Use either APK patching or Frida injection for dynamic bypass.

**Q: Is this legal?**
A: Yes, for testing on your own devices and authorized applications. Always respect app terms of service and local laws.

**Q: Can I export captured traffic?**
A: Yes! Export as HAR, cURL, Python, or Postman collections.

**Q: Does it work on iOS apps?**
A: iOS setup works for proxy interception. APK patching is Android-only, but you can use Frida on jailbroken iOS devices.
